Kinto library for ESP8266 Arduino

## Installation
To install this library, just place this entire folder as a subfolder in your Arduino/lib/targets/libraries folder.

## Building
After this library is installed, you just have to start the Arduino application.

To use this library in a sketch, go to the Sketch | Import Library menu and select ESP8266Kinto. This will add a corresponding line to the top of your sketch: #include <ESP8266Kinto.h>

To stop using this library, delete that line from your sketch.
